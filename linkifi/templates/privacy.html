        <h3>What does Linkifi do?</h3>
        <p>Linkifi is the launchpad to your latest video, article, recipe, tour, store, website, social post, and other content. We connect your audience to wherever you are online, and make your content more discoverable and eas ier to manage. Our Website
            (located at https://linktr.ee/) and other digital properties (such as our mobile app and Developer Portal) (together our “Platform”) provides information about us and allows individuals and businesses to sign-up as Linkifi Users (to create
            a personalised, easily-customisable page), as Subscribers (to subscribe to and follow Linkifi Users), or as developers (to create functionality that interacts with our Platform) (together, the “Linkifi Services“).</p>
        <p>The pages that Linkifi Users are able to create using the Linkifi Services are referred to in this Privacy Notice as “User Profiles“. User Profiles are accessible by the public.</p>
        <p>We are headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and have offices in Sydney. For more information about Linkifi, please see the “About” section of our Website at https://linkifi.ee/about/.</p>
        <h3>How does this Privacy Notice apply to me?</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Notice only applies to personal information we collect as a controller from:</p>
        <p>visitors to our Platform
            <spam> (“Platform Visitors“);</spam>
        </p>
        <p>individuals, representatives of individuals, or companies that sign up to use our Linkifi Services via a paid plan
            <spam>(“Paid Plan Users“)</spam> or free plan
            <spam>(“Free Plan Users“),</spam> together our “Linkifi Users“;</p>
        <p>individuals that sign up to subscribe to and/or follow User Profiles (“Subscribers“);</p>
        <p>individuals that visit and interact with User Profiles (“Profile Visitors“);</p>
        <p>developers that sign up to our Developer Portal in order to build functionality that interacts with the Linkifi Services (“Linkifi Developers”); and</p>
        <p>individuals who respond to our surveys, marketing materials or participate in trade promotions or competitions that we may run from time to time.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Notice, applies to the processing of personal information by Linkifi as a controller. When we talk about Linkifi acting as a “controller”, we mean that Linkifi determines the purpose and the means of the processing (i.e. we make decisions
            about how we will handle your personal information). Because of the nature of our services, we can also act as a “processor” on behalf of Linkifi Users. This means that, when we are instructed by a Linkifi User, we can facilitate processing
            of Profile Visitors’ and Subscribers’ personal information on behalf of that Linkifi User (“Processor Services“). This Privacy Notice does not address Processor Services. If you are a Profile Visitor or Subscriber, and want to know how a Linkifi
            User handles your personal information, please get in touch with the Linkifi User directly and/or refer to any privacy notice on the relevant User Profile.</p>
        <p>If you provide us with information about another person (if, for example, you are a representative of an individual), you must provide them with a copy of this Privacy Notice and let that other person know that we use their personal information
            in the ways set out in this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>
        <p>The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:</p>

                to which your account relates) and marketing preferences. If you are a Paid Plan User we will also ask for your full name, billing email address, billing address and payment method in order to facilitate billing. If you are a Subscriber,
                we will ask you to provide your email address or SMS number.To opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails or SMS
                we may send you or completing our Data Request Form.You may also provide us with your personal data when you submit queries or make a report to us (such as an Intellectual Property Report or Counter Notice). For example, we may ask you
                to provide your name and email address so that we can respond to your queries. If you are making an Intellectual Property Report or Counter Notice, we ask you to provide your name, address, email address, phone number and details regarding
                the intellectual property rights concerned.If you are a Profile Visitor, a User might request that you provide your email address, mobile number, date of birth or age, or other personal information in order to access elements of a User
                Profile (such as locked content). We may use the results of such access (i.e. successful or unsuccessful access attempts) to produce aggregated statistics for our own internal purposes and to improve the Linkifi Services.You may also provide
                personal information voluntarily if you respond to our surveys, marketing materials, or through your participation in trade promotions and competitions we may run from time to time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

                User Profile, we will also notify relevant Subscribers to that User Profile that updates have been made.</p>

                to us.</p>

                to erase or destroy any personal information that may have been collected or stored by us about that individual.</p>

        <h3>Legal basis for processing personal information</h3>
        <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific circumstances in which we collect it.</p>
        <p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by
            your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests
            or those of another person.</p>
        <p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences
            if you do not provide your personal information). As indicated above, we require certain personal information to enter into a contract with you as a Linkifi User. Without your personal information, we will be unable to provide you with Linkifi
            Services available to Linkifi Users.</p>
        <p>If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to develop and improve the Linkifi Services, to provide additional functionality, to ensure appropriate
            security or to implement sensitive content warnings and content moderation. We may have other legitimate interests, and if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
        <h3>Who may we disclose your personal information to?</h3>
        <li>
            <p>to our group companies, third party services providers (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Platform or Linkifi Services), or who otherwise process personal information
                for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information. A list of our current group companies is available here and a list of our current service providers and partners is available
                here. We also facilitate third party payment providers and this is set out in more detail below;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>to the extent we introduce social media log-ins in the future, we may provide personal data to the relevant social media provider to facilitate such log-in;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights,
                or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>to an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only
                for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</p>
        </li>
        <p>In order to facilitate paid products and/or services within the Linkifi Service, we use third party payment processors. We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third party payment processors
            whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policies and their own terms and conditions. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by payment card industry data security standards (“PCI-DSS”) as managed by
            the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information. The payment processors
            we work with are:</p>
        <h3>Disclosure of personal information to other countries</h3>
        <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases,
            may not be as protective).</p>
        <p>Specifically, Linkifi may transfer personal information to the United States and other countries in which we do business. Linkifi may also subcontract certain activities and share your personal information with third parties located outside of
            Australia (which is where we are headquartered).</p>
        <p>The countries in which these organisations are located will vary, but, in the course of our business operations, we generally disclose personal information to organisations located in Australia, or the United States. Such transfers are made in
            order to provide the Linkifi Services and carry out the activities specified in this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable data protection laws. These include entering into data transfer agreements between
            our group companies and these can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request. No transfer of your personal
            information will take place to an organisation or another country unless we believe there to be adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information. For more details please see the “How do we secure
            your personal information” section below.</p>
        <h3>How do we use cookies and similar tracking technology?</h3>
        <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and use personal information about you. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie
            Notice.
        </p>
        <h3>How long do we retain your personal information?</h3>
        <p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice and in each case in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of permitted or required retention
            periods and limitation periods relevant to legal action.</p>
        <h3>How do we secure your personal information?</h3>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.</p>
        <p>In addition we limit access to your personal information to employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need for access. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to
            a duty of confidentiality.</p>
        <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify
            you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        <h3>What are your rights in relation to personal information?</h3>
        <p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>
        <li>
            <p>If you wish to access, correct or update your personal information, you can do so at any time by completing our Data Request Form.</p>
        </li>
        <p>Depending on the country which you live in and the laws that apply to you, you may also have additional data protection rights. If you are resident in the UK or the European Economic Area, these rights include:</p>
        <li>
            <p>To request deletion of your personal information. You can do so at any time by completing our Data Request Form.</p>

        <li>

                nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        </li>
